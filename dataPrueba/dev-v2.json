Due to the role of p73 in tumor suppression and neural development, its expression and activity are tightly regulated by multiple mechanisms, including transcription and posttranslational modifications. Here, we found that p73 mRNA stability is regulated by RNPC1, an RNA binding protein and a target of the p53 family. We also showed that a CU-rich element in the 3' untranslated region of p73 is recognized by and responsive to RNPC1. To explore the physiological significance of RNPC1-regulated p73 expression, we showed that the loss of RNPC1 in p53-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to reduced expression of p73, along with decreased expression of p21, p130, and \u03b3-H2A.X, and consequently a decreased number of senescent cells. Furthermore, we observed that knockdown of TAp73 or p21, another target of RNPC1, attenuates the inhibitory effect of RNPC1 on cell proliferation and premature senescence, whereas combined knockdown of TAp73 and p21 completely abolishes it.

Here, we showed that upon knockdown of p73, particularly TAp73 but not \u0394Np73, MCF10A cells formed irregular and near-normal acini without hollow lumen in three-dimensional culture.

In order to verify the potential involvement of p73 in reproductive aging, we determined its expression in single mature MII oocytes from two groups of women, younger than 35 or older than 38 years, respectively. We found that TAp73 isoforms are down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. We confirmed these data in pools of mouse oocytes.

Binding of this receptor to its cognate ligands, programmed death ligand (PDL)-1 and PDL-2, down-regulates signals by the TCR, promoting T-cell anergy and apoptosis, thus leading to immune suppression. Here, we find that using an anti-PD-1 antibody (CT-011) with Treg-cell depletion by low-dose cyclophosphamide (CPM), combined with a tumor vaccine, induces synergistic antigen-specific immune responses and reveals novel activities of each agent in this combination. This strategy led to complete regression of established tumors in a significant percentage of treated animals, with survival prolongation. We show for the first time that combining CT-011 and CPM significantly increases the number of vaccine-induced tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells, with simultaneous decrease in infiltrating Treg cells. Interestingly, we find that CT-011 prolongs Treg-cell inhibition induced by CPM, leading to a sustainable significant synergistic decrease of splenic and tumor-infiltrated Treg cells.

In clinical trials, immunologic responses have been observed, however responses may be muted by inhibitory pathways. The PD1/PDL1 pathway is an important element contributing to tumor-mediated immune suppression. In this study, we demonstrate that myeloma cells and DC/tumor fusions strongly express PD-L1. Compared with a control population of normal volunteers, increased PD-1 expression was observed on T cells isolated from patients with myeloma.

PURPOSE: CT-011 is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that modulates the immune response through interaction with PD-1, a protein belonging to the B7 receptor family present on lymphocytes. The objectives of this phase I study were to assess the dose-limiting toxicities, to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and to study the pharmacokinetics of CT-011 administered once to patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seventeen patients were treated with escalating doses of CT-011 ranging from 0.2 to 6 mg/kg. For pharmacokinetic analysis, blood samples were withdrawn from the patients before and immediately after treatment and at 24 hours, 48 hours, and on days 7, 14, and 21. CT-011 blood levels were assessed with a specific ELISA and derived concentrations were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters. Activation of the immune system was assessed by measuring peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+, and CD69+ lymphocytes. RESULTS: The study showed the antibody to be safe and well tolerated in this patient population. No single maximum tolerated dose was defined in this study. Clinical benefit was observed in 33% of the patients with one complete remission. Pharmacokinetic analyses show that serum Cmax and the AUC of CT-011 increased proportionally with dose. The median t1/2 of CT-011 ranged from 217 to 410 hours. Sustained elevation in the percentage of peripheral blood CD4+ lymphocytes was observed up to 21 days following CT-011 treatment.

Mechanisms driving differential reactivation rates and differences in drug action are not known. We use a computational model of a TB granuloma formation that includes TNF/TNF receptor dynamics to elucidate these mechanisms. Our analyses yield three important insights. First, drug binding to membrane-bound TNF critically impairs granuloma function. Second, a higher risk of reactivation induced from Ab-type treatments is primarily due to differences in TNF/drug binding kinetics and permeability. Apoptotic and cytolytic activities of Abs and pharmacokinetic fluctuations in blood concentration of drug are not essential to inducing TB reactivation.

BACKGROUND: Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy may be associated with opportunistic infections (OIs). OBJECTIVE: To describe the spectrum of non-tuberculosis OIs associated with anti-TNF therapy and identify their risk factors. METHODS: A 3-year national French registry (RATIO) collected all cases of OI in patients receiving anti-TNF treatment for any indication in France. A case-control study was performed with three controls treated with anti-TNF agents per case, matched for gender and underlying inflammatory disease. RESULTS: 45 cases were collected of non-TB OIs in 43 patients receiving infliximab (n=29), adalimumab (n=10) or etanercept (n=4) for rheumatoid arthritis (n=26), spondyloarthritides (n=3), inflammatory colitis (n=8), psoriasis (n=1) or other conditions (n=5). One-third (33%) of OIs were bacterial (4 listeriosis, 4 nocardiosis, 4 atypical mycobacteriosis, 3 non-typhoid salmonellosis), 40% were viral (8 severe herpes zoster, 3 varicella, 3 extensive herpes simplex, 4 disseminated cytomegalovirus infections), 22% were fungal (5 pneumocystosis, 3 invasive aspergillosis, 2 cryptococcosis) and 4% were parasitic (2 leishmaniasis). Ten patients (23%) required admission to the intensive care unit, and four patients (9%) died. Risk factors for OIs were treatment with infliximab (OR=17.6 (95% CI 4.3 - 72.9); p<0.0001)or adalimumab (OR=10.0 (2.3 to 44.4); p=0.002) versus etanercept, and oral steroid use >10 mg/day or intravenous boluses during the previous year (OR=6.3 (2.0 to 20.0); p=0.002). CONCLUSION: Various and severe OIs, especially those with intracellular micro-organisms, may develop in patients receiving anti-TNF treatment. Monoclonal anti-TNF antibody rather than soluble TNF receptor therapy and steroid use >10 mg/day are independently associated with OI."},{"qas":[{"id":"516be1d6298dcd4e5100006a_001","question":"What is the mode of inheritance of nemaline myopathy?","answers":[{"text":"Autosomal recessive","answer_start":477}]}],"context":"Genotype-phenotype correlations in nemaline myopathy caused by mutations in the genes for nebulin and skeletal muscle alpha-actin.

Here we analyze missense alleles of Drosophila E(z), selected for molecular study because of their dominant genetic effects. Four missense alleles identify key E(Z) SET domain residues, and a fifth is located in the adjacent CXC domain. Analysis of mutant PRC2 complexes in vitro, and H3-K27 methylation in vivo, shows that each SET domain mutation disrupts PRC2 histone methyltransferase. Based on known SET domain structures, the mutations likely affect either the lysine-substrate binding pocket, the binding site for the adenosylmethionine methyl donor, or a critical tyrosine predicted to interact with the substrate lysine epsilon-amino group. In contrast, the CXC mutant retains catalytic activity, Lys-27 specificity, and trimethylation capacity.

Here, we report that the methyltransferase activity of CARM1 is negatively regulated through phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue. When the serine residue is mutated to glutamic acid, which mimics the phosphorylated serine residue, the mutant CARM1 exhibits diminished ability to bind the methyl donor adenosylmethionine and diminished histone methylation activity. Moreover, such mutation leads to the inhibition of CARM1 transactivation of estrogen receptor-dependent transcription.

The conserved enzyme catalyzes the reaction of methionine and ATP to the ubiquitous methyl group donor SAM. SAM is the main methyl group donor for methyltransferases to modify DNA, RNA, protein, metabolites, or phospholipid target substrates.

However, the exact molecular mechanism or mechanisms of the inhibitory effect were unclear. While SAMe is a methyl donor, MTA is an inhibitor of methylation. SAMe can convert to MTA spontaneously, so the effect of exogenous SAMe may be mediated by MTA. The aim of our current work is to examine whether the mechanism of SAMe and MTA's inhibitory effect on proinflammatory mediators might involve modulation of histone methylation. In RAW cells, we found that LPS induced TNFalpha expression by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. SAMe and MTA treatment inhibited the LPS-induced increase in gene transcription. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that LPS increased the binding of trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) to the TNFalpha promoter, and this was completely blocked by either SAMe or MTA pretreatment. Similar effects were observed with LPS-mediated induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). LPS increased the binding of histone methyltransferases Set1 and myeloid/lymphoid leukemia to these promoters, which was unaffected by SAMe or MTA. The effects of MTA in RAW cells were confirmed in vivo in LPS-treated mice. Exogenous SAMe is unstable and converts spontaneously to MTA, which is stable and cell-permeant. Treatment with SAMe doubled intracellular MTA and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels. SAH also inhibited H3K4 binding to TNFalpha and iNOS promoters.

However, a distinct lag period exists not only in the recognition but also in the medical treatment of patients with MEN2. Here we present a comprehensive genetic and clinical analysis of MEN2 among Chinese families followed from 1975 to 2011. Our series comprises 36 index cases and 134 relatives from 11 independent families. METHODS: Genetic diagnosis was performed in all participants by direct sequencing all relevant RET exons. Thyroidectomy was performed in 50 patients with varying cervical neck dissection procedures. Patients with pheochromocytoma (PHEO) underwent specific surgery. Demographic, clinical profiles, mutation types, tumor histopathologic features, and follow-up records were systematically analyzed. RESULTS: The RET mutations p.C634Y (n=34), p.C634R (n=6), p.C618S (n=13), p.V292M/R67H/R982C (n=7), p.L790F (n=2), and p.C634Y/V292M/R67H/R982C (n=1) were confirmed in 31 index cases and then identified in 32 at-risk relatives (mutation carriers), with MEN2A as the most common clinical subtype. The overall penetrance of PHEO in patients with MEN2A was 46.7%. A total of 50 patients underwent thyroidectomy, and there was a significant lowering of their mean age at thyroidectomy and the tumor diameter of the mutation carriers that were detected and operated on compared with the index cases (age at first surgery: 29.3 vs. 39.3 years, p<0.05; maximum size: 1.1 vs. 3.3 cm, p<0.001). There was also a decrease in the TNM staging and the proportion of patients who underwent inappropriate initial thyroid surgery (pN1: 31.6% vs. 100%, p<0.001; inappropriate surgery: 0% vs. 29%). Meanwhile, disease-free survival (DFS) increased (DFS: 100% vs. 58.1%, p<0.05). Both medullary thyroid carcinoma-specific (n=1) and PHEO-specific (n=5) deaths were reported during the study period.

The role of RAS mutations, in particular HRAS mutations, in sporadic RET-negative MTC has not been fully explored yet.

UNLABELLED: The RET proto-oncogene (REarranged during Transfection; RET) plays an important role in the causation of many thyroid tumours. Germline RET proto-oncogene missense mutations have been clearly linked to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2A, MEN2B). METHODS: We investigated a cohort of MEN2-related patients referred to Tygerberg Hospital, W Cape (2003-2009). The study cohort was divided into three groups based on pathology (viz. MEN/MTC, phaeochromocytoma, and a miscellaneous group of MEN pathologies). Families with identified high-risk factors were recalled. Serum calcitonin levels were monitored where indicated. DNA was extracted from whole blood by standard techniques and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products screened for RET gene variations by heteroduplex single-strand duplication techniques (heteroduplex single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis) being validated with automated sequencing techniques showing conformational variants in acrylamide gel. RESULTS: We screened 40 persons, male/female ratio 1:1.5. Three ethnic groups were represented (white (12), black (11) and mixed race (17)). Nine were index MTC cases, 5 phaeochromocytoma, 3 Hirschsprung's disease-MEN associations and 2 miscellaneous (1 neuroblastoma, 1 intestinal neuronal dysplasia), while 1 fell into the MEN2B category. The remaining 19 were unaffected relatives screened for carrier status, among whom afamilial recurrence was observed in 7. On genetic testing, an RET point mutation at the high-risk 634 cysteine allele was identified in 11 cases. A further cysteine radical mutation at the 620 position was related to MEN2 in 3 families plus 1 other family referred from elsewhere. Other less-recognised gene variations were detected throughout the RET gene in 70% of cases and included the 691 position on codon 11 (11 cases); the 432 position (4 cases, 1 homozygous) intronic mutations on exon 4 (1 case); and an IVS19-37G/C and a D1017N variation in exon 19 in 2 MEN families. Fifteen MTC patients have had thyroidectomies, of which 2 were prophylactic (C-cell hyperplasia; early occult MTC). A further 3 are awaiting prophylactic surgery. CONCLUSION: RET gene mutation carries a risk of MEN2 and MTC in all ethnic groups in South Africa. Prophylactic surgery may prevent MTC, so genetic screening is important to identify and treat high-risk patients."},{"qas":[{"id":"5171438a8ed59a060a000007_006","question":"What is the gene frequently mutated in Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) and Hisrchsprung disease?","answers":[{"text":"RET","answer_start":1407}]}],"context":"RET proto-oncogene mutations are restricted to codon 618 in Cypriot families with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2. BACKGROUND: RET germline mutations predispose to the development of inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2). Several variants of the RET proto-oncogene including G691S and S904S have been suggested to act as genetic modifiers at the age of onset ofMEN2. AIM: The aim of this study is to characterize clinically and molecularly 7 Cypriot patients with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and 1 with MEN2A and also to determine the allelic frequencies of the RET variants G691S and S904S. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seven probands from FMTC families and 1 from MEN2A were screened for the presence of RET mutations and the G691S and S904S variants. Additionally, 226 healthy Cypriots, who served as controls were analysed in an attempt to compare the frequencies of G691S and S904S RET variants to those observed in the 8 patients. RESULTS: The clinical diagnosis of the probands was based on clinical presentation and supported with biochemical findings. The germline C618R mutation of exon 10 was identified in all 8 probands and in 15 relatives from 7 different families. No significant difference in the G691S/S904S variants allele frequencies between patients (4/16 or 25%) and controls (124/452 or 27.4%) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Mutational screening of the RET gene identified a common mutation (C618R) in all 8 (7 FMTC and 1 MEN2A) unrelated Cypriot patients which may be explained by a founder effect. Additionally, no association of the G691S/S904S variants was linked with the disease."},{"qas":[{"id":"5171438a8ed59a060a000007_007","question":"What is the gene frequently mutated in Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) and Hisrchsprung disease?","answers":[{"text":"RET","answer_start":1345}]}],"context":"Familial associations in medullary thyroid carcinoma with Hirschsprung disease: the role of the RET-C620 \"Janus\" genetic variation. INTRODUCTION: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is associated with the later development of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2), because RET gene variations are associated with both conditions. Specifically, HSCR-MEN2 cosegregation mostly relates to the cysteine-rich area at the RET-620 (the \"Janus gene\"). AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical and genetic associations of HSCR-MEN2 in a cohort of HSCR patients. METHODS: RET gene variation was evaluated by heteroduplex single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and validated with automated sequencing techniques in HSCR patients (including 18 kindreds). Those with RET C620 variations were subjected to familial evaluation for coexisting HSCR-MEN2. RESULTS: A cohort of 118 patients with HSCR (n = 89) or medullary thyroid carcinoma (n = 29) were studied, including 3 families where a RET-620 point mutation was identified. No C618, C609, or C611 variations were detected. In 1 remarkable 6-generational family (family 3), HSCR in early generations seemed to be later replaced by MEN2A. In the other 2 families with total colonic aganglionosis, a relative with a medullary thyroid carcinoma was identified.

OBJECTIVE: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the context of autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), which are caused by activating germline mutations in the RET proto-oncogene. The aim of this study was to characterize the RET mutational spectrum in MEN2 families and apparently sporadic MTC (AS-MTC) cases originating from the central region of Portugal. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied a total of 82 individuals (64 affected and 18 family members), comprising five MEN2 families (four MEN2A and one MEN2B), as well as 53 AS-MTC cases. RET germline mutations were screened using PCR-DNA sequencing, SSCP and RFLP. The haplotypes associated with recurrent mutations were determined by fragment analysis of microsatellite markers, and by RFLP, in the case of intragenic polymorphisms. RESULTS: Frequency of the Cys611Tyr (TGC-TAC) mutation was significantly increased in this region of Portugal, due to the fact that three apparently unrelated MEN2A/FMTC families, out of the five in which mutations were identified, harboured this specific mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed that a common haplotype was shared between two of these three families. We have also characterized a novel RET mutation, Arg886Trp, located in the tyrosine kinase domain, which was found in an AS-MTC case. CONCLUSIONS: There are regional specificities in the relative frequency of RET mutations, which are consistent with a cluster-like distribution of specific disease-causing mutations, as a result of the inheritance of a shared haplotype. These data, along with the finding of a novel RET mutation (Arg886Trp), have important implications towards facilitating and improving the molecular diagnosis of hereditary MTC on a regional basis."},{"qas":[{"id":"5171438a8ed59a060a000007_014","question":"What is the gene frequently mutated in Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN2) and Hisrchsprung disease?","answers":[{"text":"RET","answer_start":1142}]}],"context":"A novel Czech kindred with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma and Hirschsprung's disease.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) occurs both sporadically and in the autosomal dominantly inherited multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes. The distinction between true sporadic MTC and a new mutation familial case is important for future clinical management of both the patient and family. The susceptibility gene for MEN 2 is the RET proto-oncogene. Systematic analysis for germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene was performed in a series of 67 patients with apparently sporadic MTC to determine whether they were true sporadic cases or unsuspected de novo MEN 2 cases. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Sixty-seven unselected patients with sporadic MTC were randomly ascertained from clinic patients from four centres. The diagnosis of MTC was confirmed by histopathology. Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes or from paraffin-embedded tissue and subsequently used for polymerase chain reaction amplification. MEASUREMENTS: Polymerase chain reaction based RET mutation analysis was performed by direct double-stranded cycle sequencing of exons 10, 11, 13 and 16, within which the majority of MEN2 mutations have been shown to occur. RESULTS: In this series, there was one proven case of germline mutation in RET codon 620, which previously has been shown to be responsible for MEN 2, thus indicating heritable disease. No germline mutation in codon 918, typical of MEN 2B, was found. CONCLUSIONS: A figure of 1.5% germline mutations in 67 apparently sporadic MTC is lower than the incidence of familial disease reported in previous series involving clinical and biochemical screening. The presence of a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in a patient with MTC indicates heritable disease. The absence of germline RET exon 10, 11, 13 or 16 mutation appears to rule out MEN 2A to a high probability, although the presence of a familial form of MTC other than classical MEN 2A cannot be excluded conclusively."},{"qas":[{"id":"51651e24298dcd4e51000054_001","question":"How many genera comprise the Flaviviridae family?","answers":[{"text":"three","answer_start":306}]}],"context":"5-acetyl-2-arylbenzimidazoles as antiviral agents.

Compounds were also tested against representatives of other virus families. Among ssRNA+ viruses were a retrovirus (Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1)), two picornaviruses (Coxsackie Virus type B2 (CVB2), and Poliovirus type-1, Sabin strain (Sb-1)); among ssRNA- viruses were a Paramyxoviridae (Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)) and a Rhabdoviridae (Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV)) representative. Among double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses was a Reoviridae representative (Reo-1). Two representatives of DNA virus families were also included: Herpes Simplex type 1, (HSV-1; Herpesviridae) and Vaccinia Virus (VV; Poxviridae). Most compounds exhibited potent activity against RSV, with EC(50) values as low as 20 nM.

The family Flaviviridae contains three genera of positive-strand RNA viruses, namely, Flavivirus, Hepacivirus (e.g., hepatitis C virus [HCV]), and Pestivirus. Pestiviruses, like bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bear a striking degree of similarity to HCV concerning polyprotein organization, processing, and function. Along this line, in both systems, release of nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) is essential for viral RNA replication. However, both viruses differ significantly with respect to processing efficiency at the NS2/3 cleavage site and abundance as well as functional relevance of uncleaved NS2-3. In BVDV-infected cells, significant amounts of NS2-3 accumulate at late time points postinfection and play an essential but ill-defined role in the production of infectious virions. In contrast, complete cleavage of the HCV NS2-3 counterpart has been reported, and unprocessed NS2-3 is not required throughout the life cycle of HCV, at least in cell culture. Here we describe the selection and characterization of the first pestiviral genome with the capability to complete productive infection in the absence of uncleaved NS2-3. Despite the insertion of a ubiquitin gene or an internal ribosomal entry site between the NS2 and NS3 coding sequences, the selected chimeric BVDV-1 genomes gave rise to infectious virus progeny. In this context, a mutation in the N-terminal third of NS2 was identified as a critical determinant for efficient production of infectious virions in the absence of uncleaved NS2-3. These findings challenge a previously accepted dogma for pestivirus replication and provide new implications for virion morphogenesis of pestiviruses and HCV."},{"qas":[{"id":"5150b807d24251bc05000072_001","question":"How many clinical trials for off-label drugs in neonates are cited in the literature.","answers":[{"text":"0","answer_start":455}]}],"context":"Paediatric investigation plans for pain: painfully slow!

Although these patients often respond clinically to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib, relapse inevitably occurs, suggesting the development of escape mechanisms that promote cell survival. Using a loss-of-function, whole genome short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, we identified that the canonical Wnt pathway contributes to the maintenance of NSCLC cells during EGFR inhibition, particularly the poly-ADP-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase 1 and 2 that positively regulate canonical Wnt signaling. Inhibition of tankyrase and various other components of the Wnt pathway with shRNAs or small molecules significantly increased the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo.

However, the effect of EGFR-TKI treatment on the prolongation of overall survival (OS) of these patients remains uncertain, although several recent studies have shown prolongation of progression free survival compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. METHODS: A total of 304 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who had postoperative recurrent disease were studied. To eliminate potential biases as possible, the matching of four potential predictive factors of responsiveness to EGFR-TKI led to the identification of 81 pairs of patients (those who were treated with gefitinib and those who were not). A deletion mutation in exon 19 and a point mutation (L858R) in exon 21 of the EGFR gene were also analyzed. We compared the OS between the two groups.

The usual clinical dose of gefitinib (250 mg/d) is only one third of its maximum tolerated dose, whereas the dose of erlotinib (150 mg/d) is at its maximum tolerated dose. In NSCLC cell lines, both TKIs have similar micromolar inhibitory concentrations. We explored whether erlotinib at 25 mg/d (trough serum concentration similar to gefitinib 250 mg/d) would be efficacious in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. METHODS: To study the inhibitory concentrations of gefitinib and erlotinib, we exposed EGFR-mutated cell lines (HCC827, H3255, PC-9, and H1975) to increasing concentrations of these TKIs. Further on, we performed a retrospective evaluation of seven patients with advanced EGFR-mutated (exon 19 deletions and L858R) NSCLC that were given erlotinib at 25 mg/d as their first EGFR TKI. RESULTS: Gefitinib and erlotinib generated similar inhibitory curves across our panel of EGFR-mutated NSCLC cell lines with overlapping mean 50% inhibitory concentration 95% confidence intervals for HCC827, PC-9, and H1975. Both drugs also displayed a high degree of correlation in mean 50% inhibitory concentration (Pearson's r = 0.99, p = 0.0417). Of the seven patients, five patients (71.5%) had partial responses to erlotinib 25 mg/d. Median progression-free survival was 17 months (95% confidence interval, 6-35 months). Toxicities were minimal, with only two (28.5%) patients having a rash and none experiencing (0%) diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: In NSCLC cell lines, gefitinib and erlotinib have similar inhibitory profiles. In patients with NSCLC and EGFR-activating mutations, a dose of erlotinib 25 mg/d (equivalent to gefitinib 250 mg/d) leads to impressive response rates and progression-free survival similar to the growing experience with the approved doses of gefitinib (250 mg/d) and erlotinib (150 mg/d).

BACKGROUND: The \"long/short\"polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in the promoter of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been proposed as a pharmacogenetic marker for antidepressant efficacy. Some but not all studies have found that the short form of 5HTTLPR (S allele) results in decreased efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To determine if the 5HTTLPR polymorphism influences the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine and paroxetine hydrochloride, 2 frequently prescribed antidepressants with differing pharmacologic profiles, in geriatric depression. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized 8-week study. SETTING: Eighteen academic and private outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: We evaluated 246 cognitively intact patients 65 years or older with major depression. INTERVENTIONS: Antidepressant therapy with 15 to 45 mg/d of mirtazapine (n = 124) or 20 to 40 mg/d of paroxetine (n = 122). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 and Geriatric Depression Scale, severity of adverse events and dosing compliance indexes, and discontinuations due to adverse events. Outcome measures were stratified according to 5HTTLPR genotypes. RESULTS: Geriatric Depression Scale scores indicated that S allele carriers treated with paroxetine showed a small impairment in antidepressant response. Among mirtazapine-treated patients, there was little indication that the 5HTTLPR genotype affected antidepressant efficacy. However, the 5HTTLPR polymorphism had a dramatic effect on adverse events. Among paroxetine-treated subjects, S allele carriers experienced more severe adverse events during the course of the study, achieved significantly lower final daily doses, and had more discontinuations at days 14, 21, 28, 42, and 49. Surprisingly, among mirtazapine-treated subjects, S allele carriers had fewer discontinuations due to adverse events, experienced less severe adverse events, and achieved higher final daily doses. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that the S allele of 5HTTLPR at the SLC6A4 locus is associated with a poor outcome after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However, the major effect was on the tolerability of these drugs rather than efficacy. Results from mirtazapine-treated patients indicate that the effect of this polymorphism on outcome may depend on the mechanism of antidepressant action."},{"qas":[{"id":"5157539ed24251bc0500008a_001","question":"Gene silencing can be achieved by RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotic organisms.

The Cas proteins, however, are not homologous to the proteins involved in RNAi and comprise numerous, highly diverged families. The majority of the Cas proteins contain diverse variants of the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a widespread RNA-binding domain. Despite the fast evolution that is typical of the cas genes, the presence of diverse versions of the RRM in most Cas proteins provides for a simple scenario for the evolution of the three distinct types of CRISPR-cas systems. In addition to several proteins that are directly implicated in the immune response, the cas genes encode a variety of proteins that are homologous to prokaryotic toxins that typically possess nuclease activity. The predicted toxins associated with CRISPR-Cas systems include the essential Cas2 protein, proteins of COG1517 that, in addition to a ligand-binding domain and a helix-turn-helix domain, typically contain different nuclease domains and several other predicted nucleases. The tight association of the CRISPR-Cas immunity systems with predicted toxins that, upon activation, would induce dormancy or cell death suggests that adaptive immunity and dormancy/suicide response are functionally coupled. Such coupling could manifest in the persistence state being induced and potentially providing conditions for more effective action of the immune system or in cell death being triggered when immunity fails."},{"qas":[{"id":"5157539ed24251bc0500008a_002","question":"Gene silencing can be achieved by RNA interference (RNAi) in eukaryotic organisms.

Here, we have identified a CRISPR-Cas effector complex that is comprised of small invader-targeting RNAs from the CRISPR loci (termed prokaryotic silencing (psi)RNAs) and the RAMP module (or Cmr) Cas proteins. The psiRNA-Cmr protein complexes cleave complementary target RNAs at a fixed distance from the 3' end of the integral psiRNAs. In Pyrococcus furiosus, psiRNAs occur in two size forms that share a common 5' sequence tag but have distinct 3' ends that direct cleavage of a given target RNA at two distinct sites.

More specifically, KLKs assist in the infiltration of immune cells through the skin and the blood brain barrier, whereas they catalyze the generation of antimicrobial peptides by proteolytic activation and further processing of protein precursors. In an attempt to integrate current knowledge, we propose KLK-mediated pathways that are putatively involved in inflammation associated with skin wounding and central nervous system disorders, including multiple sclerosis.

In this review, recent bioinformatics and experimental evidence is presented indicating that kallikreins are potential miRNA targets. The available experimental approaches to investigate these interactions and the potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications are also discussed. miRNAs represent a possible regulatory mechanism for controlling kallikrein expression at the post-transcriptional level. Many miRNAs were predicted to target kallikreins and a single miRNA can target more than one kallikrein.

Conflicting data, however, have made the validity of these propositions unclear. Here, we use a new computational method to identify phylogenetically conserved noncoding elements (PCNEs) in a manner that is not biased by rearrangement and duplication.

We test 42 of our PCNEs in transgenic zebrafish assays--including examples from vertebrates and amphioxus--and find that the majority are functional enhancers. We find that PCNEs are enriched around genes with ancient synteny conservation, and that this association is strongest for extragenic PCNEs, suggesting that cis-regulatory interdigitation plays a key role in repressing genome rearrangement. Next, we classify mouse and zebrafish genes according to association with PCNEs, synteny conservation, duplication history, and presence in bidirectional promoter pairs, and use these data to cluster gene functions into a series of distinct evolutionary patterns.

Traditionally, MS has been considered a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the central white matter in which ensuing demyelination results in physical disability [Frohman EM, Racke MK, Raine CS (2006) N Engl J Med 354:942-955]. More recently, MS has become increasingly viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder in which neuronal loss, axonal injury, and atrophy of the CNS lead to permanent neurological and clinical disability. Although axonal pathology and loss in MS has been recognized for >100 years, very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Progressive axonal loss in MS may stem from a cascade of ionic imbalances initiated by inflammation, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and energetic deficits that result in mitochondrial and cellular Ca2+ overload. In a murine disease model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice lacking cyclophilin D (CyPD), a key regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), developed EAE, but unlike WT mice, they partially recovered. Examination of the spinal cords of CyPD-knockout mice revealed a striking preservation of axons, despite a similar extent of inflammation. Furthermore, neurons prepared from CyPD-knockout animals were resistant to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species thought to mediate axonal damage in EAE and MS, and brain mitochondria lacking CyPD sequestered substantially higher levels of Ca2+. Our results directly implicate pathological activation of the mitochondrial PTP in the axonal damage occurring during MS and identify CyPD, as well as the PTP, as a potential target for MS neuroprotective therapies."},{"qas":[{"id":"5139b31dbee46bd34c000004_009","question":"Which is the most widely used model for the study of multiple sclerosis (MS)?","answers":[{"text":"experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)","answer_start":331}]}],"context":"The role of the humoral immune system in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The pathogenic events in multiple sclerosis (MS) that result in immune cell infiltration, multifocal demyelination and axonal loss have been focused by the strong impact of the classical MS model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) towards the hypothesis that MS is an entirely T cell-mediated disease. Although conspicuous humoral immune responses have been known since Kabal's seminal finding of elevated immunoglobulins (Igs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), only in the past few years evidence derived from recent studies of the MS lesion of anti-myelin antibodies (Abs) in patients with early MS and of MS animal models has led to a renewed interest in the role for B cells, plasma cells and their products in the pathogenesis of MS. This review surveys the actual data concerning the role of the humoral immune system in MS and EAE and explains potential modes of action and long-time persistence in the inflamed brain tissue as a B cell-supportive microenvironment in MS. These mechanisms include the modulation of antigen presentation and costimulation to T cells, increased myelin opsonisation und recruitment of inflammatory cells to the CNS, but also immunoregulatory influences on the remyelination by anti-myelin B cells and Abs. So, affecting the humoral immune system in MS would be a reasonable therapeutic option."},{"qas":[{"id":"5139b31dbee46bd34c000004_010","question":"Which is the most widely used model for the study of multiple sclerosis (MS)?","answers":[{"text":"experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)","answer_start":477}]}],"context":"Targeting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis lesions to a predetermined axonal tract system allows for refined behavioral testing in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. In multiple sclerosis (MS) the structural damage to axons determines the persistent clinical deficit patients acquire during the course of the disease. It is therefore important to test therapeutic strategies that can prevent or reverse this structural damage. The conventional animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), typically shows disseminated inflammation in the central nervous system, which leads to a clinical deficit that cannot be directly attributed to a defined tract system. For this reason we have developed a localized EAE model, in which large inflammatory lesions are targeted to the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, an area including the corticospinal tract. These lesions show the pathological hallmarks of MS plaques and lead to reproducible and pronounced deficits in hindlimb locomotion. Because of the anatomical specificity of this technique we can now use highly sensitive behavioral tests that assess the functional integrity of specific axonal tracts. We show that these tests are predictive of the site and extent of a given lesion and are more sensitive for assessing the clinical course than the scales commonly used for disseminated EAE models. We believe that this targeted EAE model will become a helpful new tool for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches for MS that attempt to protect axons or support their repair."},{"qas":[{"id":"5139b31dbee46bd34c000004_011","question":"Which is the most widely used model for the study of multiple sclerosis (MS)?","answers":[{"text":"experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)","answer_start":211}]}],"context":"Behavioral testing strategies in a localized animal model of multiple sclerosis.

Many individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) experience clinically significant pain, yet the underlying neural mechanisms for MS pain are not understood. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-studied disease in rodents that mimics many clinical and pathological features of MS, including central nervous system inflammation and demyelination. To determine whether EAE is an appropriate model for MS-related pain, nociceptive responses in both male and female SJL mice were measured before and after immunization with myelin proteolipid protein peptide 139-151 (PLP(139-151)) in complete Freund's adjuvant to induce 'active' EAE. To determine if changes in nociception were due to direct effects of encephalitogenic T cells, nociceptive responses in female SJL mice were measured following the transfer of activated, PLP(139-151) specific T cells to induce 'passive' EAE. Both forepaw and tail withdrawal latencies to a radiant heat stimulus were measured. In both active and passive EAE, there was an initial increase in tail withdrawal latency (hypoalgesia) that peaked several days prior to the peak in motor deficits during the acute disease phase. During the chronic disease phase, tail withdrawal latencies decreased and were significantly faster than control latencies for up to 38 days post-immunization. This hyperalgesia was seen in both sexes and in both active and passive EAE models. Forepaw withdrawal latencies remained within 1-2 s of baseline latencies for the entire testing period, indicating that the hypoalgesia and hyperalgesia were most pronounced in clinically affected body regions.

Both multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), its animal model, involve inflammatory attack on central nervous system (CNS) white matter, leading to demyelination and axonal damage. Changes in astrocytic morphology and function are also prominent features of MS and EAE. Resting astrocytes form a network that is interconnected through gap junctions, composed mainly of connexin43 (Cx43) protein. Although astrocytic gap junctional connectivity is known to be altered in many CNS pathologies, little is known about Cx43 expression in inflammatory demyelinating disease. Therefore, we evaluated the expression of Cx43 in spinal cords of EAE mice compared with healthy controls. Lumbar ventral white matter areas were heavily infiltrated with CD11beta-immunoreactive monocytes, and within these infiltrated regions loss of Cx43 immunoreactivity was evident. These regions also showed axonal dystrophy, demonstrated by the abnormally dephosphorylated heavy-chain neurofilament proteins. Astrocytes in these Cx43-depleted lesions were strongly glial fibrillary acidic protein reactive. Significant loss (38%) of Cx43 protein in EAE mouse at the lumbar portion of spinal cords was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Decreased Cx43 transcript level was also observed on cDNA microarray analysis. In addition to changes in Cx43 expression, numerous other genes were altered, including those encoding adhesion and extracellular matrix proteins. Our data support the notion that, in addition to damage of myelinating glia, altered astrocyte connectivity is a prominent feature of inflammatory demyelination."},{"qas":[{"id":"5139b31dbee46bd34c000004_014","question":"Which is the most widely used model for the study of multiple sclerosis (MS)?","answers":[{"text":"experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)","answer_start":498}]}],"context":"RON-regulated innate immunity is protective in an animal model of multiple sclerosis.

Treatment of differentiated human monocytoid cells with MSP resulted in significant reduction of interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and MMP-9 mRNA levels, whereas minimal effects were observed in human astrocytes. After induction of EAE, RON knockout and heterozygote animals exhibited significantly increased CNS proinflammatory gene (TNF-alpha, MMP-12) expression compared with wild-type littermate controls, although IL-4 levels were suppressed in both RON-deficient groups. Neurological disease in RON-deficient animals showed a more rapid onset with overall worsened severity, together with exacerbated demyelination, axonal injury, and neuroinflammation after EAE induction. The proto-oncogene, c-Cbl, which modulates ubiquitylation of RON, was increased in glia in both MS brains and EAE spinal cords.

IVIG was only effective in EAE when administered in a prophylactic treatment protocol, since IVIG infusions during the established phase of EAE did not alter the disease course or the degree of inflammation found in the central nervous system. IVIG also has the potential to act through myelin repair mechanisms as evidenced by work done in the Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus model of demyelination. Together these observations have led to certain expectations for IVIG as a treatment for MS, and have resulted in various clinical trials. Several controlled trials report beneficial effects of IVIG on relapse rate, new MRI lesions, and disease progression in relapsing-remitting MS, while a remyelinating effect of IVIG has not been documented.

Here, we have demonstrated the potential of lovastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, for the restoration of impaired remyelination mediated through enhanced survival and differentiation of OPs in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals. Lovastatin treatment significantly increased the level of myelin lipids in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals, coinciding with the attenuation of disease severity and inflammatory demyelination as compared with untreated EAE animals. The increased expression of myelin proteins and transcription factors associated with differentiating oligodendrocytes along with the increase in number of NG2+/BrdU- and NG2+/BrdU+ cells, and the expression of proliferating OP-specific proteins, demonstrated the restoration of remyelination in the spinal cord of lovastatin-treated EAE animals. Corresponding to this, in vitro studies further corroborated the increased survival and differentiation of OPs in lovastatin-treated activated mixed glial cells suggesting that lovastatin protects against the degeneration of OPs and enhances their differentiation through induction of a pro-remyelinating environment in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals.

Although first described as early as 1898 and long considered a vestigial organelle of little functional importance, the primary cilium has become one of the hottest research topics in modern cell biology and physiology. Primary cilia are nonmotile sensory organelles present in a single copy on the surface of most growth-arrested or differentiated mammalian cells, and defects in their assembly or function are tightly coupled to many developmental defects, diseases and disorders. In normal tissues, the primary cilium coordinates a series of signal transduction pathways, including Hedgehog, Wnt, PDGFRalpha and integrin signaling. In the kidney, the primary cilium may function as a mechano-, chemo- and osmosensing unit that probes the extracellular environment and transmits signals to the cell via, e.g., polycystins, which depend on ciliary localization for appropriate function. Indeed, hypomorphic mutations in the mouse ift88 (previously called Tg737) gene, which encodes a ciliogenic intraflagellar transport protein, result in malformation of primary cilia, and in the collecting ducts of kidney tubules this is accompanied by development of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (PKD). While PKD was one of the first diseases to be linked to dysfunctional primary cilia, defects in this organelle have subsequently been associated with many other phenotypes, including cancer, obesity, diabetes as well as a number of developmental defects. Collectively, these disorders of the cilium are now referred to as the ciliopathies.

The lysosomal storage disorder Fabry disease is characterized by excessive globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation in major organs such as the heart and kidney. Defective lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A (Gla) is responsible for excessive Gb3 accumulation, and one cell sensitive to the effects of Gb3 accumulation is vascular endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is associated with Fabry disease and excessive cellular Gb3. We previously demonstrated that excessive vascular Gb3 in a mouse model of Fabry disease, the Gla-knockout (Gla(-/0)) mouse, results in abnormal vascular function, which includes abnormal endothelium-dependent contractions, a vascular phenomenon known to involve cyclooxygenase (COX). Therefore, we hypothesized that the vasculopathy in the Gla knockout mouse may be due to a vasoactive COX-derived product. To test this hypothesis, vascular reactivity experiments were performed in aortic rings from wild-type (Gla(+/0)) and Gla(-/0) mice in the presence and absence of specific and nonspecific COX inhibitors. Specific inhibition of COX1 or COX2 in endothelium-intact rings from Gla(-/0) mice decreased overall phenylephrine contractility compared with untreated Gla(-/0) rings, whereas COX inhibitors had no effect on contractility in endothelium-denuded rings. Nonspecific inhibition of COX with indomethacin (10 micromol/l) or COX1 inhibition with valeryl salicylate (3 mmol/l) improved endothelial function in rings from Gla(-/0) mice, but COX2 inhibition with NS-398 (1 micromol/l) further increased endothelial dysfunction in rings from Gla(-/0) mice.

Urine glycolipid (Gb(3)) was elevated at baseline and fell impressively on ERT where patients were hemizygotes and in the absence of renal transplantation. In heterozygotes and in a recipient of a renal allograft, elevations and changes in urine glycolipids were less pronounced.

Sequencing of the alpha-Gal A coding region, intron/exon boundaries and 5'-flanking region from the proband identified a single mutation, a G-->A transition 30 nt upstream from the initiation of translation codon in exon 1. The -30G-->A mutation occurred in a putative NF kappa B/Ets consensus binding site that was recently shown to inhibit protein binding to the 5'-untranslated region of the gene, providing a possible explanation for its high activity. To further characterize the mutation, the mRNA and protein expressed by this variant allele were studied. Purified plasma and lymphoblast alpha-Gal A activity from individuals with the -30G-->A mutation had normal physical and kinetic properties. In vitro translation of mRNAs from the cloned normal and high plasma activity alleles resulted in similar levels of alpha-Gal A protein, indicating that this mutation did not enhance translation. These findings suggest that the -30G-->A mutation in the 5'-untranslated region of the alpha-Gal A gene enhances transcription, presumably by interfering with the binding of negatively-acting transcription factors which normally decrease alpha-Gal A expression in various cells. Preliminary studies of the frequency of the -30G-->A mutation in 395 unrelated normal males of mixed ancestry revealed two additional unrelated individuals who had high plasma enzymatic activity and the mutation, confirming the effect of this mutation on enzyme expression and suggesting that about 0.5% of normal individuals have high plasma alpha-Gal A activity due to this variant allele."},{"qas":[{"id":"5147c088d24251bc05000026_001","question":"Which type of lung cancer is the most strongly associated with Lambert-Eaton syndrome?","answers":[{"text":"small-cell lung cancer","answer_start":166}]}],"context":"[Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

Human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells are believed to express the antigens responsible for the production of pathological antibodies in the Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES), a Ca2+ channel disorder in which quantal transmitter release from the motor nerve terminal is impaired. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used to study the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels expressed by H146 SCLC cells and the effects of LES antibodies on these channels. The types of Ca2+ channels were determined using biophysical properties and pharmacological sensitivity to several antagonists. 2. Whole-cell Ca2+ currents (ICa) in SCLC cells are sensitive to the dihydropyridine (DHP) nicardipine, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTX GVIA) and omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-AgTX IVA). Nicardipine at 100 nM and 10 microM reduced ICa by 35 and 45% (n = 38 cells), respectively, while omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) inhibited ICa by 32% (n = 31). Application of omega-AgTX IVA at 50 and 100 nM to the cancer cells decreased ICa by 41 and 42%, respectively (n = 22). 3. Measurement of cell membrane capacitance (Cm) revealed that Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis underlies the secretory activity of SCLC cells. Exocytosis, when induced by step depolarizing pulses and measured by increases in Cm, was markedly inhibited by nicardipine (10 microM) and omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM). In contrast, omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) was not as effective in altering increases in Cm. 4. From negative (-80 mV) and depolarized (-40 mV) holding potentials, both peak and plateau ICa were inhibited by the presence of LES antibodies (1 mg ml-1 IgG). LES serum also reduced depolarization-induced increases in Cm by 48% (n = 15). 5. To determine whether the LES antibodies are downregulating a specific type(s) of Ca2+ channel, nicardipine (10 microM), omega-CgTX GVIA (1 microM) or omega-AgTX IVA (100 nM) was applied to tumour cells that had been previously exposed to LES serum for 24 h. The most pronounced change was that omega-AgTX IVA was 38-84% less effective at reducing ICa after the IgG treatment. The effectiveness of nicardipine was diminished by 18% after incubation with the LES antibodies, whereas the omega-CgTX GVIA was seen to be more effective. These results suggest that LES IgG downregulates P-type Ca2+ channels and, possibly, to a lesser extent L-type channels. 6. In view of recent evidence that P-type Ca2+ channels mediate cholinergic transmitter release at the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the expression of P-type Ca2+ channels in the SCLC cells and the reactivity of LES IgG with these channels support the hypothesis that P-type Ca2+ channels in these cancer cells may trigger the autoantibody production in this disorder. The antibodies so produced are implicated in the functional impairment of the Ca2+ channels characteristic of LES."},{"qas":[{"id":"5147c088d24251bc05000026_007","question":"Which type of lung cancer is the most strongly associated with Lambert-Eaton syndrome?","answers":[{"text":"small-cell lung cancer","answer_start":837}]}],"context":"Sequential fluctuating paraneoplastic ocular flutter-opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome in small-cell lung cancer.

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by defective neurotransmitter release at presynaptic terminals. It is caused by an IgG autoantibody reacting against voltage-gated calcium channels. Severe LEMS complicated by ventilatory failure is rare. We report a case of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) presenting with LEMS and ventilatory failure in a 67-year-old man who initially presented with progressive limb weakness for 6 months and tachypnea with shallow breathing for 1 week. LEMS was diagnosed through electrophysiologic studies. Chest radiography and computerized tomography showed a huge mass lesion over the left anterior and middle mediastinum with an encasement of the left pulmonary artery. Cytologic examination of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration disclosed SCLC. Successful treatment in combination with plasma exchange and chemotherapy resulted in dramatic tumor regression and LEMS remission, which were confirmed by chest radiography and electrophysiologic studies. This case suggests that plasma exchange and chemotherapy can be effective in treating SCLC with severe LEMS that produces ventilatory failure."},{"qas":[{"id":"5148691bd24251bc0500002d_001","question":"Which protein is affected by dusp8 activation?","answers":[{"text":"JNK","answer_start":1519}]}],"context":"Prevention of JNK phosphorylation as a mechanism for rosiglitazone in neuroprotection after transient cerebral ischemia: activation of dual specificity phosphatase.

Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins.

Some functional differences between these gene products have been demonstrated, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and the roles of individual splice variants are still incompletely understood. We have investigated the interaction of M3/6 with JNK isoforms, as well as scaffold proteins of the JNK interacting protein (JIP) family, in order to elucidate the contribution of M3/6 to the regulation of distinct JNK signaling modules. M3/6 exhibited stronger binding towards JNK1\u03b2 and JNK2\u03b1 isoforms and this was reflected in higher enzymatic activity towards JNK2\u03b12 when compared to JNK1\u03b11 in vitro. After activation of the pathway by exposure of cells to arsenite, the interaction of M3/6 with JNK1\u03b1 and JNK3 was enhanced, whereas that with JNK1\u03b2 or JNK2\u03b1 decreased. The modulation of binding affinities was found to be independent of JNK-mediated M3/6 phosphorylation. Furthermore, arsenite treatment resulted in an inducible recruitment of M3/6 to JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) scaffold complexes, while its interaction with JIP1 or JIP2 was constitutive.

Polyglutamine expansion-induced stress shared common features with protein-damaging stress such as heat shock, because activation of JNK involved inhibition of JNK phosphatase activities. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Aggregation of M3/6 by polyglutamine expansion appeared to be indirect, because M3/6 was not recruited into polyglutamine inclusions. The heat shock protein HSP70, which is known to inhibit JNK during the heat shock response, suppressed polyglutamine-mediated aggregation of M3/6 and activation of JNK.

The actions of benzodiazepines are due to the potentiation of the neural inhibition that is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Practically all effects of the benzodiazepines result from their actions on the ionotropic GABA(A) receptors in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines do not activate GABA(A) receptors directly but they require GABA. The main effects of benzodiazepines are sedation, hypnosis, decreased anxiety, anterograde amnesia, centrally mediated muscle relaxation and anti-convulsant activity. In addition to their action on the central nervous system, benzodiazepines have a dose-dependent ventilatory depressant effect and they also cause a modest reduction in arterial blood pressure and an increase in heart rate as a result of a decrease of systemic vascular resistance. The four benzodiazepines, widely used in clinical anaesthesia, are the agonists midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam and the antagonist flumazenil. Midazolam, diazepam and flumazenil are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation whereas lorazepam directly undergoes glucuronide conjugation. CYP3A4 is important in the biotransformation of both midazolam and diazepam. CYP2C19 is important in the biotransformation of diazepam. Liver and renal dysfunction have only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam but they slow down the elimination of the other benzodiazepines used in clinical anaesthesia. The duration of action of all benzodiazepines is strongly dependent on the duration of their administration. Based on clinical studies and computer simulations, midazolam has the shortest recovery profile followed by lorazepam and diazepam. Being metabolized by CYP enzymes, midazolam and diazepam have many clinically significant interactions with inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and 2C19. In addition to pharmacokinetic interactions, benzodiazepines have synergistic interactions with other hypnotics and opioids. Midazolam, diazepam and lorazepam are widely used for sedation and to some extent also for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or treat benzodiazepine overdose."},{"qas":[{"id":"514a0a57d24251bc05000051_007","question":"Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?","answers":[{"text":"Flumazenil","answer_start":79}]}],"context":"Continuous-infusion flumazenil in the management of chlordiazepoxide toxicity.

BACKGROUND: Flumazenil is a competitive benzodiazepine antagonist that acts to reverse their sedative and hypnotic effects. It is indicated in the management of benzodiazepine overdose, but its role in the routine reversal of endoscopic conscious sedation has not been defined. METHODS: Patients undergoing diagnostic upper endoscopy who received sedation with either diazepam or midazolam alone were given flumazenil 0.2 mg incrementally immediately following the procedure until awake. They were then asked to repeat three psychomotor tests measuring cognitive and motor skills, with their baseline scores compared with postprocedure scores over a 3-hour period. RESULTS: Full psychomotor function was restored to baseline values within 30 minutes after flumazenil in 79% of patients, with no differences in the reversal of psychomotor skill impairment observed between diazepam and midazolam sedation. There was no evidence of rebound sedation seen for up to 3 hours. No significant anterograde amnesia was evident in 78% of individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that flumazenil's effects on reversing psychomotor impairment are similar when midazolam or diazepam are used for conscious sedation. However, the potential usefulness of routine flumazenil reversal of conscious sedation will require further evaluation of specific psychomotor performance skills (such as driving a car) before we lift the admonition against leaving the endoscopic suite unattended, driving a vehicle, or operating complicated machinery for several hours."},{"qas":[{"id":"514a0a57d24251bc05000051_014","question":"Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?","answers":[{"text":"flumazenil","answer_start":179}]}],"context":"Empiric use of flumazenil in comatose patients: limited applicability of criteria to define low risk. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To develop clinical rules for the safe and effective use of flumazenil in suspected benzodiazepine overdose. METHODS: We assembled a retrospective series of 35 consecutive comatose patients admitted between October 1992 and July 1993 to a toxicologic ICU with the presumptive diagnosis of drug overdose. These patients were divided into two groups. Group A (low-risk) patients had a clinical picture compatible with uncomplicated benzodiazepine intoxication (calm, without abnormalities in pulse or blood pressure, lateralizing signs, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, or myoclonus) in the absence of predefined electrocardiographic or clinical signs of tricyclic antidepressant or other proconvulsant overdose, and absence of an available history of long-term benzodiazepine treatment or an underlying seizure disorder. Group B (\"non-low risk\") comprised all other patients. Efficacy of flumazenil was categorized as complete awakening (with normal level of alertness), partial awakening, or no change in alertness level. The safety of flumazenil was defined on the basis of the absence of seizures or death. RESULTS: In group A (n=4), flumazenil was associated with complete awakening in three patients and partial awakening in one. No seizures were observed. In group B (n=31), flumazenil was associated with complete awakening in 4 patients, partial awakening in 5, and no response in 22. In group B, five seizures occurred. CONCLUSION: Comatose patients with clinical or ECG criteria thought to contraindicate the use of flumazenil have a reasonably high risk of seizures after administration of this drug. Low-risk patients may be able to receive flumazenil safely, but they may be only a small portion of comatose patients with suspected overdose."},{"qas":[{"id":"514a0a57d24251bc05000051_015","question":"Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?","answers":[{"text":"flumazenil","answer_start":687}]}],"context":"Use of flumazenil in the treatment of drug overdose: a double-blind and open clinical study in 110 patients.

The first 31 patients were studied in a double-blind fashion, while the rest of the patients were given flumazenil according to an open protocol. INTERVENTIONS; All patients received supplemental oxygen; endotracheal intubation was performed, and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation was initiated whenever it was deemed necessary. A peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted, as were indwelling arterial and urinary bladder catheters. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, and core temperature were continuously monitored. The first 31 double-blind patients received either intravenous flumazenil (to a maximum of 1 mg) or saline, while the rest of the patients were given flumazenil until either regaining consciousness or a maximum of 2.5 mg was injected. Patients remaining unconscious among double-blind patients or those patients relapsing into coma after the first dose were later treated in the open phase of the study.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Twenty-five percent of the patients did not regain consciousness. These patients had very high serum concentrations of nonbenzodiazepine drugs. Sixty percent of the responders who had primarily ingested benzodiazepines remained awake for 72 +/- 37 mins after flumazenil administration; 40% relapsed into coma after 18 +/- 7 mins and various central nervous system depressant drugs were detected in their blood in addition to benzodiazepines.

OBJECTIVE: In the assessment and management of the potentially poisoned patient with altered consciousness, the most consequential and controversial interventions occur during the first 5 minutes of care. In this review article, the risks and benefits of standard diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are presented to guide clinicians through this critical period of decision making. DATA SOURCES: Data for discussion were obtained from a search of English-language publications referenced on MEDLINE for the years 1966 to 1994. Older literature was included when pertinent. Search terms included poisoning, overdose, toxicity, naloxone, glucose, thiamine, and flumazenil. STUDY SELECTION: Only large trials were used for determinations of diagnostic utility and efficacy. Small trials, case series, and case reports were reviewed extensively for adverse effects. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Trials were reviewed for overall methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sources of bias, and outcome. CONCLUSION: Analysis favors empirical administration of hypertonic dextrose and thiamine hydrochloride to patients with altered consciousness. Although rapid reagent test strips can be used to guide this therapy, they are not infallible, and they fail to recognize clinical hypoglycemia that may occur without numerical hypoglycemia. Administration of naloxone hydrochloride should be reserved for patients with signs and symptoms of opioid intoxication.

Hepatic dysfunction results in a substantial change in the pharmacokinetic profile of flumazenil; therefore, dosage adjustment may be necessary in patients with hepatic dysfunction or in those receiving medications that alter flumazenil metabolism. Flumazenil has been shown to reverse sedation caused by intoxication with benzodiazepines alone or benzodiazepines in combination with other agents, but it should not be used when cyclic antidepressant intoxication is suspected. It may be beneficial after surgery when benzodiazepines have been used as part of anesthesia and after a diagnostic or surgical procedure when assessment of CNS function is necessary."},{"qas":[{"id":"514a0a57d24251bc05000051_022","question":"Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?","answers":[{"text":"Flumazenil","answer_start":125}]}],"context":"Treatment of benzodiazepine overdose with flumazenil.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if flumazenil, when used in doses higher than those currently recommended, could reverse the effects of a benzodiazepine (BDZ) overdose in patients who might not otherwise respond and whether the higher dose was associated with increased adverse effects. DESIGN: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced, with parallel groups. Open-label flumazenil administration was available if a patient failed to respond or became resedated. SETTING: Sixteen emergency departments in the United States. POPULATION: Patients presenting to the ED with clinically significant signs and symptoms of a known or suspected BDZ overdose. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive 10 mL/min of placebo or flumazenil (1 mg/10 mL) each minute for ten minutes. If there was no response, up to 3 mg of open-label flumazenil could be administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 170 patients enrolled, 87 received flumazenil and 83 received placebo. The demographic characteristics of both groups were comparable. Ten minutes after the beginning of study drug infusion, patients were evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GSC), and Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale (NAS). The mean +/- SD CGIS score at ten minutes for BDZ-positive patients was 1.41 +/- 0.72 for patients who received flumazenil and 3.41 +/- 0.91 for the placebo group (P < .01). There was no difference in the mean CGIS score between the flumazenil (3.25 +/- 1.15) and placebo (3.75 +/- 0.69) groups in BDZ-negative patients. The GCS and NAS were also significantly better in patients who were BDZ-positive and received flumazenil. The mean +/- SD dose of flumazenil administered during the double-blind phase was 71.3 +/- 34.2 mL (7.13 mg) compared with 95.06 +/- 16.03 mL of placebo. Of the 39 patients who had BDZ-positive drug screens and received flumazenil, 29 (74%) responded to 3 mg or less. Six additional patients responded to 4 or 5 mg, and one patient responded to 8 mg. The most common adverse effects in patients who received flumazenil were injection site pain (10.3%), agitation (8%), vomiting (3.4%), dizziness (3.4%), headache (3.4%), tachycardia (3.4%), and crying (3.4%). Three patients developed seizures. Two were associated with significant tricyclic antidepressant overdoses and one with propoxyphene ingestion. Two patients had positive drug screens for BDZ. CONCLUSION: Flumazenil rapidly and effectively reverses the clinical signs and symptoms of a BDZ overdose. Most patients will respond to 3 mg or less, but a small number may require a higher dose for reversal of clinical symptoms. Patients with concomitant tricyclic antidepressant overdose may be at risk for developing seizures."},{"qas":[{"id":"514a0a57d24251bc05000051_029","question":"Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?","answers":[{"text":"Flumazenil","answer_start":233}]}],"context":"Anterograde amnesia in triazolam overdose despite flumazenil treatment: a case report.

Flumazenil is a recently discovered pharmacologic antagonist of the CNS effects of benzodiazepines. It acts by binding CNS benzodiazepine receptors and competitively blocking benzodiazepine activation of inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Animal studies and some human studies appear to demonstrate that flumazenil has weak intrinsic agonist activity; on the other hand, studies are inconclusive in demonstrating any inverse agonist effects of this agent. Evidence available suggests that flumazenil is well tolerated in human beings over a broad range of doses when given either orally or parenterally and does not produce serious adverse effects. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reversing coma within one to two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hours. Repeat doses can be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines. Flumazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration; should this drug receive approval, it is likely to be used in emergency departments as well as in a variety of other clinical settings. First, it could be used to effect rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has been administered to facilitate medical, orthopedic, and surgical procedures, particularly in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression. Second, flumazenil might have a therapeutic role in the management of patients who have taken benzodiazepine overdoses. Although most of these patients can be managed successfully with supportive therapy alone, it is possible that the use of flumazenil may obviate the need for intubation and respiratory support in such patients and eliminate the possible adverse effects of even short-term endotracheal intubation. Finally, flumazenil could have both diagnostic and therapeutic value in patients with acute alterations of mental status of unknown etiology, particularly when possible drug overdose is a consideration. Because flumazenil appears to be specific in its antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced respiratory and CNS depression, it could be used empirically to confirm or exclude a role of benzodiazepines in the generation of mental status changes in the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin. This in turn might obviate the need for further expensive (eg, computed tomography) and sometimes invasive (eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities. This might be particularly useful because there is nothing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that clearly distinguishes it from other causes of coma; thus, there are no signs or symptoms that may reasonably allow benzodiazepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated on clinical grounds. Further studies will continue to define the ultimate use of this new agent."},{"qas":[{"id":"514a0a57d24251bc05000051_031","question":"Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?","answers":[{"text":"flumazenil","answer_start":473}]}],"context":"[Clinical experience in benzodiazepine antagonist].

In a randomized double-blind study, 18 patients (group 1) and eight patients (group 2) with suspected benzodiazepine overdose received 5 mg (group 1) or 1 mg (group 2) flumazenil or placebo, respectively. The stage of coma, heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate were monitored within the following 15 min. If no change in the stage of coma was observed, 5 mg (group 1) or 1 mg (group 2) flumazenil were given, and the stage of coma, heart rate and blood pressure were again monitored. In a similar way, the effect of 5 and 1 mg flumazenil was investigated in 13 patients (group 3) and four patients (group 4) with ethanol intoxication. In an open trial, the clinical efficacy of flumazenil for the diagnosis of benzodiazepine or ethanol overdose was studied in 29 patients (group 5). In all patients, a toxicological screening confirmed benzodiazepine or ethanol overdose. None of the patients receiving placebo showed effects on stage of coma, heart rate, blood pressure or respiratory rate. Patients with benzodiazepine overdose who received 5 mg flumazenil regained consciousness about 1-2 min after the end of injection. The effect of 1 mg flumazenil (group 2) on benzodiazepine-induced coma was less pronounced. In patients with ethanol overdose (group 3), ethanol-induced coma was reversed after 5 mg flumazenil more slowly than in patients of group 1. No effect of flumazenil on ethanol-induced coma was observed in group 4. In group 5, flumazenil proved to be useful for diagnosing benzodiazepine or ethanol intoxication. In one patient with coma due to carbamazepine overdose, flumazenil was also found to be effective.

Flumazenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a highly effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when the effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated or terminated at short notice. It acts by displacing other benzodiazepines from the receptor site by competitive inhibition. The onset of effect after intravenous administration occurs within 1 to 3 minutes. The optimal dosage is determined for each patient by a dose titration procedure and lies in the range 0.2 to 1.0mg in anaesthesiology, and 0.1 to 2.0mg in intensive care use.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, usefulness, safety, and dosages of flumazenil required when flumazenil is used in the diagnosis of benzodiazepine-induced coma (vs. other drug-induced coma), and to reverse or prevent the recurrence of unconsciousness. DESIGN: A two-phase study: a controlled, randomized, double-blind study followed by a prospective, open study. SETTING: An 800-bed, teaching, university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Unconscious patients (n = 110) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. The first 31 patients were studied in a double-blind fashion, while the rest of the patients were given flumazenil according to an open protocol. INTERVENTIONS; All patients received supplemental oxygen; endotracheal intubation was performed, and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation was initiated whenever it was deemed necessary. A peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted, as were indwelling arterial and urinary bladder catheters. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory rate, end-tidal CO2, and core temperature were continuously monitored. The first 31 double-blind patients received either intravenous flumazenil (to a maximum of 1 mg) or saline, while the rest of the patients were given flumazenil until either regaining consciousness or a maximum of 2.5 mg was injected. Patients remaining unconscious among double-blind patients or those patients relapsing into coma after the first dose were later treated in the open phase of the study. Treatment continued by boluses or infusion as long as efficacious. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.8 +/- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 14 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scores of 3.1 +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients had high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Twenty-five percent of the patients did not regain consciousness. These patients had very high serum concentrations of nonbenzodiazepine drugs. Sixty percent of the responders who had primarily ingested benzodiazepines remained awake for 72 +/- 37 mins after flumazenil administration; 40% relapsed into coma after 18 +/- 7 mins and various central nervous system depressant drugs were detected in their blood in addition to benzodiazepines. Seventy-one percent of the patients had ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Seventy-eight percent of the responders were continually and efficaciously treated for < or = 8 days. Fourteen (25%) of the intubated patients were extubated safely while 12 patients, who had shown increased respiratory insufficiency, resumed satisfactory respiration after flumazenil injection. Five cases of transient increase in blood pressure and heart rate were encountered. There were 27 mildly unpleasant \"waking\" episodes, such as anxiety, restlessness, and aggression, but no patient had benzodiazepine withdrawal signs, convulsions, or dysrhythmia, most noticeably absent in tricyclic antidepressant-intoxicated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil is a valid diagnostic tool for distinguishing pure benzodiazepine from mixed-drug intoxication or nondrug-induced coma. Flumazenil is effective in preventing recurrence of benzodiazepine-induced coma. Respiratory insufficiency is reversed after its administration. Flumazenil is safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed overdose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants."},{"qas":[{"id":"514a0a57d24251bc05000051_041","question":"Which drug should be used as an antidote in benzodiazepine overdose?","answers":[{"text":"flumazenil","answer_start":1500}]}],"context":"A clinical trial of escalating doses of flumazenil for reversal of suspected benzodiazepine overdose in the emergency department.

Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) proved to be a very efficacious competitive antagonist of benzodiazepines that reliably counteracts their pharmacological actions within 1-2 min as could be demonstrated in clinical and EEG studies. In general, a total dose of 0.3-0.8 mg will be sufficient in clinical practice, avoiding side effects like nausea, tremor, sweating, or transient anxiety that could be observed when higher dosages were administered. Its therapeutic range is very high as could be demonstrated in experimental animal in which up to 8.000-fold the clinical dose was administered. The total volume of distribution (Vdes) amounts to nearly 1.000 ml/kg BW and the total clearance exceeds 1.200 ml/min, resulting in a biological half-life of less than 60 min.

Hence, a careful observation of the antagonised patient on the ward is mandatory for 1.5-2 h, even if at first sight the antagonization seemed successful and the patient fully awake and cooperative.

Prolactinoma is the most common secreting pituitary adenoma. It is typically diagnosed in women of reproductive age and is common cause of infertility. Currently the treatment of choice is pharmacotherapy with dopamine agonists, whereas surgical treatment is reserved for a selected group of patients. Pituitary-tumor apoplexy is a rare, life-threatening condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The authors present the case of a 25-year-old woman with prolactinoma treated with dopamine agonist. In course of such a treatment the patient became pregnant. The bromocriptine was gradually withdrawn. In the 14th week of pregnancy she was admitted for symptoms suggesting pituitary tumor apoplexy. The treatment with bromocriptine was reinitiated. In the 20th week of pregnancy further deterioration of the patient's neurological condition and visual-field abnormalities were observed. The patient was qualified for surgical treatment - selective transsphenoidal adenomectomy. The successful surgery led to improvement of neurological condition. The early postoperative PRL level decreased significantly and hormonal function of the pituitary was preserved. The pregnancy ended in 38th week with a caesarean section. Endocrinological evaluation conducted after the uneventful delivery confirmed normal function of the pituitary. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not reveal tumor re-growth. The patient is kept under constant medical care.

The effects were reproduced by Dnmt1 knockdowns in T cells from young subjects.

This chemical modification can alter gene expression without altering DNA sequence. While DNMT3a is mostly involved in de novo methylation, DNMT1 acts as a maintenance methyltransferase. We aimed to investigate the immunoexpression of DNMT3a and DNMT1 in minor salivary gland neoplasms, comparing it with normal tissue.

Dnmt1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) is the principal enzyme responsible for maintenance of cytosine methylation at CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome. The N-terminal replication focus targeting sequence (RFTS) domain of Dnmt1 has been implicated in subcellular localization, protein association, and catalytic function. However, progress in understanding its function has been limited by the lack of assays for and a structure of this domain. Here, we show that the naked DNA- and polynucleosome-binding activities of Dnmt1 are inhibited by the RFTS domain, which functions by virtue of binding the catalytic domain to the exclusion of DNA. Kinetic analysis with a fluorogenic DNA substrate established the RFTS domain as a 600-fold inhibitor of Dnmt1 enzymatic activity. The crystal structure of the RFTS domain reveals a novel fold and supports a mechanism in which an RFTS-targeted Dnmt1-binding protein, such as Uhrf1, may activate Dnmt1 for DNA binding."},{"qas":[{"id":"51585b28d24251bc0500008d_043","question":"Which enzyme is involved in the maintenance of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methylation?","answers":[{"text":"DNMT1","answer_start":191}]}],"context":"Structure of DNMT1-DNA complex reveals a role for autoinhibition in maintenance DNA methylation.

We have solved structures of mouse and human DNMT1 composed of CXXC, tandem bromo-adjacent homology (BAH1/2), and methyltransferase domains bound to DNA-containing unmethylated CpG sites. The CXXC specifically binds to unmethylated CpG dinucleotide and positions the CXXC-BAH1 linker between the DNA and the active site of DNMT1, preventing de novo methylation. In addition, a loop projecting from BAH2 interacts with the target recognition domain (TRD) of the methyltransferase, stabilizing the TRD in a retracted position and preventing it from inserting into the DNA major groove.

Global DNA hypomethylation at CpG islands coupled with local hypermethylation is a hallmark for breast cancer, yet the mechanism underlying this change remains elusive. In this study, we showed that DNMT1, which encodes a methylation maintenance enzyme, is a transcriptional target of BRCA1. BRCA1 binds to the promoter of the DNMT1 gene through a potential OCT1 site and the binding is required for maintaining a transcriptional active configuration of the promoter in both mouse and human cells. We further demonstrated that impaired function of BRCA1 leads to global DNA hypomethylation, loss of genomic imprinting, and an open chromatin configuration in several types of tissues examined in a BRCA1 mutant mouse model at premaligant stages. BRCA1 deficiency is also associated with significantly increased expression levels of several protooncogenes, including c-Fos, Ha-Ras, and c-Myc, with a higher expression in tumors, while premalignant mammary epithelial cells displayed an intermediate state between tumors and controls. In human clinical samples, reduced expression of BRCA1 correlates with decreased levels of DNMT1, and reduced methylation of CpG islands. Thus, BRCA1 prevents global DNA hypomethylation through positively regulating DNMT1 expression, and this provides one of mechanisms for BRCA1-associated breast cancer formation."},{"qas":[{"id":"51585b28d24251bc0500008d_045","question":"Which enzyme is involved in the maintenance of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methylation?","answers":[{"text":"Dnmt1","answer_start":156}]}],"context":"Localization of DNA methyltransferase-1 during oocyte differentiation, in vitro maturation and early embryonic development in cow. DNA methyltransferase-1 (Dnmt1) is involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns and is crucial for normal mammalian development. The aim of the present study was to assess the localization of Dnmt1 in cow, during the latest phases of oocyte differentiation and during the early stages of segmentation. Dnmt1 expression and localization were assessed in oocytes according to the chromatin configuration, which in turn provides an important epigenetic mechanism for the control of global gene expression and represents a morphological marker of oocyte differentiation. We found that the initial chromatin condensation was accompanied by a slight increase in the level of global DNA methylation, as assessed by 5-methyl-cytosine immunostaining followed by laser scanning confocal microscopy analysis (LSCM). RT-PCR confirmed the presence of Dnmt1 transcripts throughout this phase of oocyte differentiation. Analogously, Dnmt1 immunodetection and LSCM indicated that the protein was always present and localized in the cytoplasm, regardless the chromatin configuration and the level of global DNA methylation. Moreover, our data indicate that while Dnmt1 is retained in the cytoplasm in metaphase II stage oocytes and zygotes, it enters the nuclei of 8-16 cell stage embryos. As suggested in mouse, the functional meaning of the presence of Dnmt1 in the bovine embryo nuclei could be the maintainement of the methylation pattern of imprinted genes.

Estrogens play a critical role in brain development by acting on areas that express estrogen receptors. In the rodent cortex, estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) mRNA expression is high early in postnatal development but declines starting at postnatal day (PND) 10 and is virtually absent in the adult cortex. The mechanisms controlling this regulation are largely unknown. Methylation is important for gene silencing during development in many tissues, including the brain. In the present study, we examined the methylation status of ER alpha 5' untranslated exons during early postnatal development in male and female mice using methylation-specific PCR and pyrosequencing. Several regions of ER alpha promoter displayed a significant increase in methylation at PND 18 and 25 compared with PND 4. DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) are important for the initiation and maintenance of methylation. Real-time PCR showed that DNMT3A, the de novo DNMT peaked at PND 10 and was decreased by PND 25. DNMT1, which is important for maintenance of methylation, increased across development and stayed high in adult cortex. The methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is also important for stabilization of methylation. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed a correlation between association of MeCP2 with ER alpha promoter and the increase in methylation and decrease in ER alpha expression after PND 10. In mice containing a mutant MeCP2 protein, ER alpha mRNA expression and promoter methylation patterns across development were different compared with wild-type mice. These data suggest that methylation of ER alpha promoters regulates ER alpha mRNA expression in the cortex during postnatal development in a MeCP2-dependent fashion."},{"qas":[{"id":"51585b28d24251bc0500008d_047","question":"Which enzyme is involved in the maintenance of DNA (cytosine-5-)-methylation?","answers":[{"text":"DNMT1","answer_start":1238}]}],"context":"Increased CXCR4 expression in AsPC1 pancreatic carcinoma cells with RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DNMT1 and DNMT3B. The effect of DNA methylation on CXCR4 expression has been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer and melanoma cells, but little is known about the effect of DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3 (DNMT1 and DNMT3B) on CXCR4 expression. Employing lentiviral vectors, we created stable RNA interference-mediated knockdown of DNMT1 and DNMT3B in AsPC1 pancreatic cancer cells. Using reverse transcription real-time quantitative PCR and flow cytometric analysis, we evaluated the increase in the expression of CXCR4 transcript and protein levels in these cells. Bisulfite sequencing analysis showed that the level of promoter demethylation appeared more effective in cells with knockdown of DNMT1 than in those with DNMT3B knockdown. Furthermore, the combined RNA interference knockdown of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B increased promoter demethylation, leading to a slight increase in CXCR4 expression. However, the demethylating agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine exhibited the strongest effect on promoter demethylation, which correlated with the highest production of CXCR4 transcript and protein in AsPC1 cells.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark essential for mammalian development, genomic stability, and imprinting. DNA methylation patterns are established and maintained by three DNA methyltransferases: DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B. Interestingly, all three DNMTs make use of alternative splicing. DNMT3B has nearly 40 known splice variants expressed in a tissue- and disease-specific manner, but very little is known about the role of these splice variants in modulating DNMT3B function. We describe here the identification and characterization of a novel alternatively spliced form of DNMT3B lacking exon 5 within the NH(2)-terminal regulatory domain. This variant, which we term DNMT3B3Delta5 because it is closely related in structure to the ubiquitously expressed DNMT3B3 isoform, is highly expressed in pluripotent cells and brain tissue, is downregulated during differentiation, and is conserved in the mouse. Creation of pluripotent iPS cells from fibroblasts results in marked induction of DNMT3B3Delta5. DNMT3B3Delta5 expression is also altered in human disease, with tumor cell lines displaying elevated or reduced expression depending on their tissue of origin. We then compared the DNA binding and subcellular localization of DNMT3B3Delta5 versus DNMT3B3, revealing that DNMT3B3Delta5 possessed significantly enhanced DNA binding affinity and displayed an altered nuclear distribution. Finally, ectopic overexpression of DNMT3B3Delta5 resulted in repetitive element hypomethylation and enhanced cell growth in a colony formation assay.

Here we show that levels of lamp2a at the lysosomal membrane are mainly controlled by changes in its half-life and its distribution between the lysosomal membrane and the matrix. The lysosomal degradation of lamp2a requires the combined action of at least two different proteolytic activities at the lysosomal membrane. Lamp2a is released from the membrane by the action of these proteases, and then the truncated lamp2a is rapidly degraded within the lysosomal matrix. Membrane degradation of lamp2a is a regulated process that is inhibited in the presence of substrates for chaperone-mediated autophagy and under conditions that activate that type of autophagy. Uptake of substrate proteins also results in transport of some intact lamp2a from the lysosomal membrane into the matrix. This fraction of lamp2a can be reinserted back into the lysosomal membrane. The traffic of lamp2a through the lysosomal matrix is not mediated by vesicles, and lamp2a reinsertion requires the lysosomal membrane potential and protein components of the lysosomal membrane.
